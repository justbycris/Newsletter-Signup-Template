# Newsletter Signup Center for National Review
This was a good challenge and one of my favorite projects. I've actually redone their newsletter sign up twice now. Coming from a very basic 2000 html design they had before my arrival. 
The first design was made with checboxes and inputs that had no CSS styling and it only consisted of their logo at the top. From then my first design draft was creating a toggle view for each 
newsletter with its title, description, and frequency. Created with HTML, CSS, and JS. See below:

This previous design worked well. Until the magazine had an entire brand new look, and I had to redesing it so it follows the new identity's guideline. That involved more JavaScript and 
different fonts and layout. See below:

This was a very fun project because there is nothing more I love more than the process of desining, developing and seeing a project come to live. It was a fun challenge and it got everyone on the NR team 
very happy and excited about it.
